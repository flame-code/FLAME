Welcome to FLAME
========================




FLAME -- a library of atomistic modeling environments --
is a software package to perform a wide range of atomistic simulations
for exploring the potential energy surfaces (PES) of complex condensed matter systems.
Available methods includes molecular dynamics simulations to sample free energy landscapes, 
saddle point searches to identify transition states, and gradient relaxations
to find dynamically stable geometries.
In addition to such common tasks, FLAME implements a structure prediction algorithm
based on the minima hopping method (MHM) to identify the ground state
structure of any system given solely the chemical composition, and a
framework to train a neural network potential to
reproduce the PES from *ab initio* calculations.
The combination of neural network potentials
with the MHM in FLAME allows highly
efficient and reliable identification of the ground state
as well as metastable structures  of molecules and crystals, 
as well as of nano structures, including surfaces, interfaces, 
and two-dimensional materials.




The FLAME Team
===============

The development of methods implemented in FLAME started back in 2007 in Basel, Switzerland, with the
implementation of various atomistic simulation tasks in 
different software packages. These tasks were later merged into two
main codes (Alborz and Minhocao), which were independently maintained and
developed by S. Alireza Ghasemi and Maximilian Amsler, respectively. 
In 2018, the FLAME code evolved as a streamlined integration 
of these two codes into a single package to 
facilitate atomistic simulation workflows.


The core developer team consists of:

*       S Alireza Ghasemi
*       Maximilian Amsler
*       Samare Rostami
*       Hossein Tahmasbi
*       Ehsan Rahmatizad
*       Somayeh Faraji
*       Robabe Rasoulkhani
